## Conditional

1. Create a program to read a number
	* If the number is even, display the text "The number is even"
	* If not, display the text "The number is odd"

2. Create a program to:
	* Read two numbers
	* Show if the first number is positive, negative or zero
	* Show whether the second number is positive, negative or zero
	* Show the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of the two numbers

3. Create a program that reads 3 integers and print how many are even and how many are odd.

4. Create a program that reads the storage capacity of a flash drive in Gigabytes, calculate and write this measurement in bytes.

5. Create a program that reads a temperature in Farenheit degrees. Calculate and write this temperature in degrees Celsius.
